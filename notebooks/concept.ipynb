    "\n",
    "Area of Focus:\n",
    "In today’s world, heart attacks are more and more prevalent. Most of the time it is directly linked to lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption. Despite increased awareness about healthy living, many individuals are still at risk because they underestimate how daily habits affect their well-being in long-term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome:\n",
    "Early detection and prevention could save lives and reduce medical costs, but traditional screening methods are often not effective, and they typically only identify problems after symptoms appear, missing critical opportunities for prevention.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to explore how machine learning can help predict the likelihood of developing a heart attack (or heart disease) based on an individual’s diet, lifestyle, and fitness-related factors. By analyzing real-world health data, our goal is to identify key risk factors and build a predictive model that can help individuals take proactive measures toward healthier living."

    "🧪 Main Hypothesis\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H₀):\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a significant relationship between an individual's diet quality, activity level, smoking, alcohol consumption and getting a heart attack.\n",
    "That is, dietary intake (protein, sugar, and sodium), activity level, smoking and alcohol consumption can be used to accurately predict whether an individual may be prone to getting a heart attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no significant relationship between an individual's diet quality, activity level, smoking, alcohol consumption and getting a heart attack.\n",
    "In other words, dietary intake (protein, sugar, and sodium), activity level, smoking and alcohol consumption do not help predict who is prone to heart attacks better than random chance."
